title: Partially through week 2
description: NSS has begun

Well, NSS is well underway. We are into our second week and I am feeling overall positive about everything. Tonight I fully understood what the next 12 months will be like, BUSY!

I am thankful I spent the past year preparing for bootcamp, this first couple weeks would feel pretty raw otherwise. I am comfortable with HTML and CSS, though not an expert. I’m hoping that day-to-day use will let it become muscle memory. For now, I feel like I’m having to think a bit too long before tackling the issue at hand. I must be patient, I am still learning (and always will).

For me, CSS is always a bit tricky. Since there is more than one way to handle styling, it can be tricky to figure out the best way or the most maintainable way. I want clean code that will be easy to pick up in 3 months time and not be totally lost. As well, there are so many ins and outs and little gotchas with CSS. For example, in my head, I’ll sometimes think it’s text-size: to adjust the font size. No, it’s font-size! In time, I’m sure those little things will go away and I won’t think twice when I adjust the size of the font.

Something we haven’t touched on much yet is responsive design. Developing mobile-first is really interesting and changes how one approaches the CSS. I am interested in diving more into this.

We also discussed Git/GitHub the past two nights. Boy am I glad I started learning and messing around with this technology months ago. It’s kind of abstract and, “Why would I need this?” at first. Of course, this version control system (VCS) is invaluable to developers and learning it is a fundamental skill. So far, we haven’t touched on anything too far out of what I already learned. One thing I did learn, I have already developed one bad habit with the way I treat my master branch! I frequently pushed directly to the master, instead of doing a pull request. Tsk tsk!

Using Git means using the command line. My roommate from college insisted I run Linux (Ubuntu) instead of windows. That was an interesting experiment and gave me fantastic exposure to the command line. Feeling at least partially comfortable in the command line has been incredibly helpful in the past few weeks and especially in NSS.

Finally, our class and instructors seem like a really good group so far. I am constantly laughing or smiling during lectures. People sitting around me seem excited to be there and eager to learn. I hope this energy continues and we can feed off each other for the next several months.
