title: CSS Zen Garden and Git/GitHub for days
description: NSS continues
---
CSS/HTML are complete and now, it’s time for JavaScript! Alright! I’m really looking forward to JS and everything else. After a little review, it should be all fresh things to learn.

Well the “little review” part was right! We jumped right into JS, playing with strings one night and arrays the next. We also dealt with regular expressions which are pretty great. I can also see how regular expressions are a huge pain!

So far, my favorite part about JS is how powerful it can be with just a little knowledge. The ability to iterate through arrays is incredible and allows us to churn through a lot of data in a short time. Some of the solutions to our challenges (think, algorithm challenges) are really quite clever. I’m looking forward to further looping methods and some functional programming (map, reduce, filter). I have traditionally struggled with these aspects of JS. I’m hopeful NSS and our wonderful instructors can set me on the right path with the proper understanding.

Today (2/26/18), our CSS Zen Garden Assignments were due. The goal was to take some CSS Zen Garden design and recreate the HTML and CSS. Our study group tackled this exercise, partially as a team and the rest as an individual. As a team we discussed the HTML structure and appropriate HTML semantic tags. Once we agreed on the HTML, we all sourced the same images (2 total) and began to code away. I chose to code all the HTML first and then tackle the CSS last.

I have always fought with CSS (who hasn’t, really?), but this was a fairly smooth styling. Perhaps the muscle memory is starting to be built. I tried to be deliberate and clean with both HTML and CSS. I feel I was reasonably successful at both, with CSS being the more challenging of the two. We used a different header image and we did not use the same font. 

Another assignment we had was, Create 25 GitHub repos (5 a day for 5 days)!

Phew! It took a very long time the first day to do all these. By day 5, it was natural and normal. A bit tedious, but it really drove home the basic cycle of Git/GitHub usage. Today at work, I listened to numerous videos discussing rebasing, squashing commits, and ‘git difftool’. These are more advanced topics and I’m still wrapping my head around them. Late yesterday, a local developer noticed my seemingly endless stream of ‘test’ repos and commits. It made for a good laugh!
