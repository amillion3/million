title: Firebase!

This week, we tackled Firebase! I am an expert and have nothing else to learn. Next topic! Just kidding, I am so far from an expert and I know so little. However, I am beginning to see the process and understand the flow using Firebase. It is kind of miraculous to know that I can setup an instance of Firebase and connect to it and do CRUD stuff! CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. It's a very important concept for full-stack developers. Big picture, I get it. On a code-level I can slowly follow along with what is happening. One big point that I mostly grasp, but still need exposure to is during the 'GET' method. Using the 'Object.keys' is somewhat abstract and I really have to step through it, almost word by word. I'm sure I'll pick up the understanding more as time goes on, but it's confusing right now.

I just checked out the homework for the week and...yikes. We need full CRUD functionality for our local-weather app by Tuesday. That sounds like a big challenge for my current understanding. I am still wrapping up the assignment, so I need to get on it!

My work is crazy busy right now and the timing is just terrible. Update - Work is still incredibly busy, logged a 13+ hour day yesterday and probably got 2-3 hours of sleep. I am dragging today. Because of this, progress on my weather app is a bit slow. However, I have my app doing GET, POST, DELETE methods successfully. I think the toughest part is doing the forEach loops to retrieve the firebase ID and apply it to a JS object for the DOM and DOM interaction.
