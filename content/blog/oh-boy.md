This is React.

React is quite challenging for me. I felt pretty okay at first with it. Setting up a project, creating components, getting components into the main App.js file, that was all just fine. Now that we have gotten into the functionality of it (Database calls/posts, mainly), I am feeling much less confident about everything. Sprinkle in a little ES6 here and there and I am lost! This is my conclusion after tinkering with React over the 4th of July.

The keyword 'this' is sometimes plainly obvious and other times, it just loses me. I really need to fully understand 'this' to feel confident in my React projects. I can usually follow along if I have a code example (IE, a code along from class), but the debugging process is when I learned how unsure I was about 'this'. Hopefully practice and exposure will help with my understanding, because I feel pretty overwhelmed right now!

I picked a capstone project and had it approved this past week, hooray! I am creating an app 'Fix That Pothole!', a map based solution where citizens can identify potholes in need of repair. My scope was very broad at first, a more specific idea was needed. I have already started making tickets and mock-ups for it. I setup a React project as well and installed 'react-geo', the crucial library for my capstone. I tried playing with it over the 4th, but it was not as easy as I hoped and expected. Zoe warned me that it would likely be tougher than I thought (of course, she was right!).
