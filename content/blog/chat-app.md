title: Chat App!
description: chatty
---
This week, we worked on a chat application. We planned the project as a team and coded the project as a team. Overall, it was a good experience and coding with a team is practice I sorely need. Case in point, I inadvertently removed one of my cohort member's code and it totally broke functionality of the app. A careless merge conflict fix was to blame. I felt a bit embarrassed about it, I'll have to take a few extra seconds when reviewing merge conflicts.

Another issue we had was when two of us merged our code together, the code I added inadvertently broke their code. A simple CSS line totally changed the functionality of his code. Neither of us were 'at fault', but without being intimately aware of each other's code, we weren't aware it would be an issue. After about 30 frustrating minutes, I tracked down the culprit!

It's also interesting working with a codebase where I don't know all of it and I didn't write a significant part of it. Some of the code was typical (XHR calls, buildDomString, printToDom, etc) while other parts were totally custom (the chat bot, for example). It is good practice reading others code and having to integrate my work with theirs.

A big downside of group work is that sometimes you are waiting on other people to review your work or other people to finish their tasks. These delays can get old quick, especially with limited time together. On the other hand, it's a good opportunity to re-read your own code, look ahead to the next ticket, or review outstanding pull requests.

We present our app on Monday, so that should be fun to see everyone's final products.
