This week we covered jQuery. I remember jQuery being easier than it was in class! Perhaps I just did the easier stuff with jQuery in my previous studies and that's why it felt surprisingly difficult. Both in freeCodeCamp and the NSS Jumpstart program, jQuery felt easier to pick up. For now, I'm stuck in a vanilla JS headspace. I want to do everything in vanilla JS and that is just muscle memory right now. I know that jQuery will get easier as time goes on, but I'm fighting myself right now.

Our task this week was to make an ex-tracker! Yes! This assignment was pretty amusing and it was a fun project. The difficulty wasn't as bad as our last few assignments as the main focus was getting used to using jQuery over vanilla JS. I had a nearly functional app working by the time class started on Saturday. Implementing the jQuery was the tough part, but the jQuery cheatsheet was a huge help. Also, it's pretty sweet how the methods are named logically, it's sometimes exactly the word(s) you expect it to be!"
