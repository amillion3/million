title: Why learn web development?
description: A background of my journey to web development
---
I started learning web development because of a single job posting in early 2016. Outdoor Alliance (a non-profit based out of Washington D.C.) had a full-time, remote job creating all sorts of web maps and hard copy maps for trails around the country. I was so excited by the opportunity, it hit so many things I was interested in! If I was going to write up a job description that would be a perfect fit for me, it would look very similar.

I put together a resume and cover letter and applied quickly. I wrote in my cover letter saying how I was excited for the position and willing to learn all the web mapping technology on my own time. I figured my dedication and excitement would make me an excellent candidate.

While I waited for them to eagerly select me as the best person for the job, I started self-teaching myself Leaflet. It was hard and I had no idea what I was doing. I could monkey together some basic maps at first, but it took a long time and I really had no idea what I was doing. I finally got a couple basic maps made, which left me feeling quite accomplished. Once it came time to start implementing them into a webpage, I was lost again. I really didn’t understand HTML/CSS/Javascript and how it all worked together.

I never heard back from Outdoor Alliance, not even a, “Thanks, but no thanks” response.","In the end, I wasn’t surprised, I didn’t match their ideal candidate requirements because I was not familiar with web mapping technology (namely, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Leaflet, etc). One thing I was learning, these are not skills you can easily pick up over a couple weeks and would take a lot of time and energy to really learn. A friend suggested I use freeCodeCamp to learn the basics. As it turned out, freeCodeCamp (FCC) is a wonderful resource for new learners. It laid an excellent framework to continue my web mapping education. I dabbled with FCC in late 2016 and really dug in at the start of 2017.

I am currently assembling a portfolio with some of my basic projects and I will be applying for a local bootcamp, the Nashville Software School (NSS). Attending NSS will allow me to have a solid foundation of full-stack development which will be invaluable for mixing programming and web mapping. I hope to network and meet all the fine people of Nashville to talk programming and related topics."
