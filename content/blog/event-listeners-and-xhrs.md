In NSS, we covered XHRs this week! Also known as XMLHTTPRequests, these are used by many languages to send and receive data from JSON or XML files, as well as servers and APIs. This is pretty exciting, to me at least! Everything has been slowly building, adding a little complexity each class. It's really neat to see how everything ties together and starts to really make our pages have functionality. I can see why falling a little behind in the beginning would make it really hard to catch up and stay up to speed. Prework is key to building those foundations and understanding (at least partially) what is happening.

I remember making XHR calls using JavaScript and it not being nearly this straight forward, I struggled and wished for a clean, easy to follow example. I gave up and used jQuery, but really wanted a vanilla JS solution. I have made a few API requests in Python and I found them much more natural than the JS variant I was trying.

This past weekend, I spent time updating my README.md files and grabbing screenshots. A bit tedious, but my repos are much prettier now! I can certainly understand why developers would skip repos without decent documentation. Some screenshots and basic install/how to run instructions goes a long ways. It should be easier to keep my READMEs up to date, I'll just do them at the end of each project.

I am team lead this week, alright! I also dig the project for this week. Sounds like a fun card page about the solar system. My daughter and her love for the planets will be so excited!!

At work, I'm wrestling with a Python script. I'm so focused on JS right now and it's been a while since I touched Python, so it's slow going. I'm sure I'll feel better about it tomorrow when I can sleep on my problems. It's great to get paid to code!
