Hard to believe, but it's been a full 3 months since our cohort began the web development journey. With that 3 month anniversary came a week break with no classes or scheduled meetings. I took full advantage of that time to purchase a newer used car, travel to coastal South Carolina to visit family and build a calculator using jQuery.

The calculator was a difficult task and I wish I had more dedicated time to work on it. My time this week was broken up and not as focused as the previous weeks. I think that contributed to the slower progress and difficulty sorting out the logic. Starting and stopping and working at odd times (during car rides, 15 minutes here, 20 minutes there) was not conducive to being productive. I learned a lot and was able to get more familiar with my jQuery selectors and DOM manipulation. I also learned how complicated calculators really are. I chose to build the calculator and I'm happy with the challenge this project gave me. I'd like to continue working on it, but we'll see how much free time the next 3 months allow.
