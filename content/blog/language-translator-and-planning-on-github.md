title: Language Translator and Planning on GitHub
description: Github planning
---
Our project from last week was to create a basic language translator. We did the planning as a group, but coded everything individually. It was my first experience using GitHub’s Project page. It was a lot more work than I was expecting! I understand why that or a Kanboard is valuable though. As Zoe said, a good project is 70% planning and 30% coding. Breaking down every single step in great detail really makes things easy to follow and easy to delegate. It’s also made me realize how ‘Wild West’ my planning has been in the past. I usually just have an idea in my head, maybe a quick sketch and then I jump right in. It certainly is more fun to go straight to coding, but I find myself without a set path or set of features to tackle.

Another great thing about attending NSS is great opportunity to work with a team and a team that rotates about every 5 weeks. I’ll get to know all my cohort members quite well and everyone brings a little something different to the team. On top of that, it’s a great opportunity to learn how to code with a team. All of my coding so far has been individual, while most jobs require you work as a team with other devs, as well as management and other roles. I certainly need practice and exposure to working effectively as a team member. My first study group has been pretty great and we have had lots of laughs.

I will dive into this more next blog post, but working with Git/GitHub as a team is a much different experience than working solo! I feel comfortable doing my own projects with no other contributors, but working as a team is honestly, a little uncomfortable right now! I want my code to be well understood and not make people scratch their heads. It’s a new element and something we will get into more with our study group and lab time this weekend.
