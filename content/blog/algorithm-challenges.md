Well, it’s been a challenging past few days. We had 10 array challenges assigned to us. They were not easy, at least for our class. They certainly dumped us off into the deep end to see how we all fared. I think some people did pretty well and other people were paralyzed with a sense of ‘where do I begin?!’.

I am fortunate that my time on freeCodeCamp exposed me to such word problems, so it was not immediately overwhelming. This experience gave me some time to think more like a programmer. For example, wrapping my head around nested for loops wasn’t too challenging. I still need a lot of practice though, as I tend to come up with extremely complex solutions when there are better and more simple solutions. A daily dose of codewars or something similar would be very beneficial to me.

Monday’s class left my head spinning. Lauren went through 6 code challenges, as completed by our study groups. After each challenge, she refactored our code in a more efficient manner. In most cases, this involved higher order functions. Higher order functions include:

* forEach() – Similar to a for loop, but easier to read. Supposedly much, much slower though.
* filter() – Accepts a callback function and executes a set of instructions to determine to keep or delete data in an array.
* reduce() – Accepts a callback function that summarizes one array into a single variable.
* map() – Accepts a callback function that transforms each item of an array in the same manner (for example, doubling each function).

I found this short set of videos from Fun Fun Function to be pretty helpful in understanding these better. In the videos, he walks through the each higher order function using a traditional for() loop and then refactors it using the filter() or map() and compares them. I found it very helpful to more completely understand them. As well, he touches on arrow functions and shows how much cleaner and shorter the code can be, it’s pretty incredible!

I know these higher order functions and functional programming is very important, so I am going to focus on learning and implementing these where it makes sense. I think it will be difficult at first, but worth it in the long run.
