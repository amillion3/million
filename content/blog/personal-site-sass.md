Tonight we start React! I am pumped for it, but I know it'll be a big challenge and change for us all. I dabbled with Wes Bos's React for Beginners, but never really buckled down and made a concerted effort to learn. I am excited to see what we can build and do with React, it seems to the hot framework in web development.

This past weekend, I finished my personal profile. Well, it's finished for now, I should say. I'll tweak it and we will do a peer review on Saturday. During Saturday's class, I was exposed to Materialize, which seems amazing. I wish I had worked with Materialize over Bootstrap! Drat. I'll have to keep that handy for some side projects. FYI, Materialize is a CSS framework built by Google after doing extensive UI/UX research.

We discussed Sass this week. Pretty neat tool to have. Sadly, I wasn't comfortable using Sass on my personal sight, so my CSS is all just regular. I would surely like to take advantage of it in the future and I see why it's a more organized way to do CSS.

One little tip that I picked up from Lauren has been immensely helpful when refactoring or fixing bugs in my code. If you select a word or phrase, you can hit 'Command + D' and VSCode will select the next instance of that exact set of characters. It's really helpful if you need to change variable names or switch out CSS colors, etc. One of those small tips that has made a big difference to my workflow! Another VS Extension I like is colored brackets. It is a quick way to visually identify blocks of code, or places where brackets are needed or not needed.
