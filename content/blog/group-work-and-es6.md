title: Group Work and ES6
description: Working as a team
---
Our group projects wrapped up this past weekend. It was a really great way to really get to know our study group and help each other out. It’s kind of sad our group split up after coming together and having a good time. Overall, it was a positive experience, but working with teams while coding will take some getting used to. I’m not in charge anymore, I can’t just make a decision and run with it.

We need to decide to approach the project in a similar way.

We need to tackle project planning and task delegation.

We need to resolve problems or disagreements along the way.

It’s been a bit of a learning curve, but it’s a good thing! Resolving git conflicts is new and interesting. Thankfully, there was no major incidents and once we got rolling, we all seemed to understand and work well as a team.

One of the most interesting things about working with a team is that my tasks need to be done, done, before submitting them. I can’t finish it 95% and come back later. I need to wrap it up entirely and then move on. As well, I can’t sit there and endlessly tweak spacing or other things. That’s a wonderful thing in my opinion!

This past Monday, NSS was closed due to the weather. I must admit, I didn’t spend the whole night on coding related work.

I was prepping for a job interview! If I get the job, programming will be roughly 1/3 of my job, which is fantastic! Fingers crossed.

I spent the other part of my Monday night watching ES6 videos and taking notes. I learned about let, const, arrow functions, and I started learning about classes. I called it quits on classes as it was getting late. It was great prep for the following night, ES6 from Lauren! Since we were short on time, she pushed through ES6 pretty fast, I’m glad I studied a bit the night before. My favorite thing I learned was template literals, super neat. Instead of concatenating strings and variables together using a variety of quotes and + signs, ES6 makes it much easier.

Dinosaur way:

* var output = “My name is ” + userName + ” and I like to ” + hobby\[0] + ” and ” + hobby\[1] + “.”;

Shiny new way:

* const output = \`My name is ${userName} and I like to ${hobby\[0]} and ${hobby\[1]}.\`;

Arrow functions are also pretty interesting and I look forward to getting more comfortable with them. The 3 takeaways I learned about arrow functions are they are small, inline and single purpose.
