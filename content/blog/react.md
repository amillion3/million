So, we started React.

There are so many moving pieces, JSX here, states up top, props over there...it is a lot to take in. Zoe mentioned pattern recognition was going to be important, so I have been doing my best to identify patterns (or things that look like they will be used repeatedly). I think I understand implementing components, both writing them and importing them. The react-boostrap is a bit unusual, but it should just be learning a few syntax issues to really feel comfortable.

Our project this week is to make a very basic page about animals, utilizing GET and POST methods with Firebase. I coded the GET method without much trouble, but I felt like, I didn't understand it. Instead of writing more code, I read through my code and created a diagram. With the diagram, I was able to better see how pieces fit together. I created a second diagram, built off the lessons of the first one, and it has been helpful.

On Saturday, we will discuss GET requests in React, we will do a 30-minute peer review of each other's personal sites, and we will discuss our capstones.

Our capstones!

I am excited and nervous. I want to create a seriously impressive app, but I don't want to bite off more than I can chew. I have a list of 15+ ideas, so hopefully I can identify a capstone that is doable in our short time frame.
