title: JavaScript Promises (continued)
description: I promise
---
This week we continued with promises and started coding with them more. It was a good experience and I am feeling more confident on them now. Still far off from being totally comfortable, but it's going in the right direction. Something I did to help, was to put together notes and code examples as a reference. This way, I can have notes that I need, right there in one place. I'm hoping that will make the coding process smoother from here on out.

Work is still quite busy, our project seems to be going off the rails. I'm sure it will require more overtime, I just don't know when I'm supposed to log extra hours. It's exhausting! It's a holiday weekend, so I'm hoping I can get caught up on homework. Sadly, I'm behind on the ex-tracker and my local-weather app is moving a little slowly. Gotta keep at it!
